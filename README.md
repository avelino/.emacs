.emacs.d
========

My emacs configurations.

Installation
------------

In theory you can just download the .emacs.d directory to your home directory and start Emacs, though if you want to get changes from GitHub, you'll need to do things a bit differently.

```
# hope you know what you're doing
rm -rf ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs
git clone git://github.com/avelino/.emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
```
